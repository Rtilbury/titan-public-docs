# Titan-X Public Documentation

Titan-X is a privacy-first adaptive intelligence engine built for developers, technical teams, and no-code builders who need real-time intelligence without storing or exploiting user data.

This repository provides public-facing documentation, architectural overviews, regulatory positioning, and early-access onboarding materials for teams exploring Titan-X.

## 🚀 What is Titan-X?

Titan-X is an adaptive intelligence layer designed to run inside *your* infrastructure — not ours.  
It processes live signals in real-time (sub-50ms), generates interpretable intelligence, and immediately discards the inputs. No raw logs. No identity graphs. No behavioural databases.

Titan-X helps teams:

- Detect friction, hesitation, anomalies, and confusion instantly  
- Adapt experiences with transparent, human-reviewable rules  
- Align with the strictest privacy and AI-safety requirements arriving in 2026  
- Add adaptive intelligence to any product — without building ML pipelines, data layers, or risk systems

## 🔐 Privacy-First Engineering

Titan-X is built around three non-negotiable principles:

### **1. Zero Data Stored**
No behavioural histories or events are ever retained. Titan-X processes signals, outputs results, and discards everything else.

### **2. Explainable by Design**
Every adaptation produced by Titan-X can be traced to signals + rules.  
No black-box models. No opaque scoring.

### **3. 2026-Ready Compliance**
Designed to align with the upcoming EU AI Act, UK digital regulation, and global privacy frameworks. Titan-X provides real-time intelligence without requiring a data lake, user journey tracking, or invasive profiling.

## ⭐ Vision

Our goal is simple:

> **Make real-time adaptive intelligence accessible to every builder — without requiring personal data, machine learning pipelines, or black-box behavioural tracking.**

Titan-X is built for the regulatory future, for developers who demand transparency, and for users who deserve privacy.
